With better insulation, green roofs, white roofs (to make use of the albedo effect), and other engineering strategies will help new and existing buildings to require less heating/cooling. This is why the Toronto Green Standard and retrofitting existing buildings is so important. Helping builders to use low carbon materials is important because concrete produces so much emissions and alternatives are often expensive and hard to come by, so owners require assistance in making sure the carbon footprint of the building itself is low.","Retrofitting may be the most challenging because there are many people who live in public housing or in old condos that require the building to do all of the retrofits, not the tenants. Incentives for rental buildings to do retrofits should be put in place.",Produce renewable natural gas from waste.,Increase installation of rooftop and ground mount solar panels.,,Accelerate investment in energy storage.,,Producing our own natural gas is important because it will divert waste from the landfill and remove the emissions that comes from transporting the gas to Toronto. Strict regulations on the pollution produced by the facilities that make the natural gas are required. Increasing solar panels on buildings and on the ground should be prioritized so energy can be used by individual houses/buildings or be put into the grid. Investing in renewable energy is imperative in transitioning away from fossil fuels. Energy storage should also be invested in due to the fluctuating nature of renewable energy sources and the need for a constant supply of energy to the grid. This will make the transition to renewables easier and more feasible.,Installing rooftop solar panels will be the most difficult for my community because there are currently few incentives to put solar panels on the roof. Good messaging from the city and financial incentives would be appreciated. Condo buildings and public housing buildings should be further incentivized and supported in installing solar panels as well.,,Increase electric vehicle charging in public spaces and on private property.,,Expand bike and pedestrian infrastructure and priority zones.,Expand public transit and accelerate implementation of bus rapid transit.,,"Expanding public transit to make it more accessible and reliable should be the main priority of the city to encourage less people to drive. Rapid bus transit is needed in many area of the cities and there should be a focus on maintaining and repairing the current subway system to make it more reliable as well. Expanding the subway or streetcar systems should also be discussed and implemented, particularly a relief line.There is currently a substantial network of bike paths in the downtown areas and in the beaches but bike and pedestrian paths are lacking in Etobicoke, Scarborough, and North York in particular. There are also not very many safe ways to travel in the North-South direction so that should be a priority for the cycling infrastructure of the city. Increasing access to electric charging should also incentivize more people to switch to electric. The city should work with other municipalities in the GTA from which many commuters come into to Toronto to make an efficient and effective network of electric charging stations. Each station should also have as many of the plug types as possible.","Increasing the speed at which the ATC signal upgrades on the TTC are done and better maintaining the whole subway system will be the most beneficial to my community as many of the residents rely on line 1 to get to their jobs. Finishing the upgrades quickly to return to better, more reliable service should be the utmost priority as weekend closures are often inconvenient. In the future overnight closures may be preferred.",,"Reduce city-wide material consumption and increase circularity (i.e., efficient re-use and recovery of resources).",,Currently the city consumes too much waste and it is not disposed of correctly. There is too much food waste from supermarkets where perfectly good food is ending up in landfills. Second hand clothing and donation centers are too few and far between and buying second hand clothing should be incentivized to the city's younger population. There is also too much plastic packaging our supermarkets and stores and it should be regulated. The other side of the problem is that the recycling system is very inefficient and much of the waste sent to the recycling is then sent to the land fill. There should be better ways to sort our recycling before it is picked up and all of the recycling pick up and processing should be publicized to ensure that it is being done correctly.,"In my community of high school - aged youth, reducing our consumption of materials, especially clothing and single use plastics, is going to be the most difficult. We ask that the city allow for 'trendy' sustainable options to become available and for there to be regulation of plastics. The city should regulate the use of the 'recyclable' symbols to only be on products that can actually be recycled in the city of Toronto (i.e. a sticker over the manufacturer's label) and to promote the sale of products in only the plastic types that are in fact recyclable and to disincentivize all other kinds","Increase tree canopy cover, biodiversity and enhance greenspaces.","Achieve equitable distribution of the urban forest, increasing tree canopy where it is most needed.",Corporate-wide adoption of a climate lens for all new City operating programs and capital projects to incorporate climate considerations in the municipal decision-making process.,,Work with Indigenous communities to share knowledge.,,,"Greenspace has been shown to cool down cities, increase the mental well-being of our citizens, and to sequester carbon in trees. Therefore increasing greenspace should be a priority. As there is a disproportionate distribution of greenspace across the city, with less tree canopy cover in low-income regions like Etobicoke North, Humber River - Black Creek, and Scarborough-Agincourt, should be prioritized. Having corporations focus on the climate aspect of all capital projects is important as well to make sure all projects in the city are in compliance with the city's climate goals. Working with Indigenous communities is also very important to make sure their heritage is honoured and to be able to use their deep knowledge of the land to have better urban planning and development of greenspaces",Increased greenspace and biodiversity will be greatly appreciated by my whole community.,"I believe that for actions required of the individual, like switching to an electric car, incentives are the most important was to encourage the uptake of actions. However, the bigger aspect of the net zero climate actions are actions that must be taken by the city. For this, funding, regulation, and infrastructure are required. Funding must be given to the TTC for example to be able to better maintain their existing infrastructure, and once they are able to provide reliable service, I believe that more people will be encouraged to take public transport. If regulation around the labelling of plastic goods increases and the city's recycling program is well funded and able to properly recycle a lot of items, consumers will be better able to reduce their waste. If the city builds adequate cycling networks that make it convenient for individuals to bike to work or to the store, more people will be willing to do so. I also believe that education, particularly of underserved communities, will help individuals to be more willing to partake in these actions so that the citizens of Toronto can work with our government to achieve our climate goals. I greatly appreciate the city's willingness to communicate with us and would love to see more surveys like this one in the future.",19-Oct,3 digits of your postal code:,M2N,Ethnic or cultural backgound:,Mixed white and Japanese,,,"East Asian (examples: Chinese, Japanese, Korean)",,,,,"White (examples: English, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Slovakian)",,Woman,,Prefer not to answer,,Prefer not to answer

I am sure we also need energy storage and wouldn't it be nice to have the support of other levels of gov't.

I'd like to see other levels of gov't provide the incentives to purchase EVS (which after all are cheaper in their life cycle anyway, but just to get people started) and I don't know anything about last mile delivery strategies so can't make an informed comment on that. Low emissions freight sounds like a good thing; is that moving goods by train rather than diesel powered trucks? that sounds like it would be good, as would EV trucks.","I think these all would be helpful.

I think it should be a priority to require all buildings to collect compost; private buildings should not be exempt. Everyone should have access to bins for compost.

We should stop the city from allowing greenspaces to be converted to yet another tower, that makes a meaner, less happy & healthy city. I have seen this happen in several downtown neighbourhoods & it is so shortsighted to allow this. A climate lens is vital for planning, absolutely, let's get out of the silos and have this across departments.

One improvement that could benefit everyone is if the Net Meter Agreement would not restrict the amount of electricity generated to equal that purhcaser, but rather to allow all the electricity generated from this renewable source to be supplied to the Toronto Hydro system even if no payment was offered beyond that amount purchased - this electricity is supplied on peak when the sun shines, and is carbon free.",1.

Perhaps if we stop building super highways, we might reverse the personal vehicle travel. 2. In order to move to personal electric vehicles, there must be charging stations. In downtown Toronto Class A commercial buildings, this has happened naturally as upper middle class individuals have made the move to electric vehicles in sufficient numbers that building owners have recognized that they must meet the needs of this market. Many more charging stations will be required to meet the move to electric vehicles. 3. Public transit within the City generally works very well, but there are improvements to be made - moving to electric vehicles is one of these.","1.

Having toured the Dufferin Waste Management site some years ago with Dianne Young, the then executive director of Echibition Place, I saw the Green Bin waste treatment facility, wherein the waste was recycled in a large drum that produced a great deal of methans. This methane was simply burned in the atmosphere. I would hope that this has been changed to prevent any methane from escaping, or even being burned in an open flame. 3.

Unfortunately, majority of people is unable to recognize this, but they will be grateful later...Another big issue is that majority of public does not know or understand the impacts of climate change on their lives - health issues, property damages, how the City can be affected in operations etc. Unfortunate example is happening right now on the West coast. It can happen in several years in Toronto. And with the influx of people (GTA is predicted to have 9.5 mil people by 2046) all will become much more complicated, especially if unregulated and unprepared.",30-54,3 digits of your postal code:,M4P,Prefer not to answer.,,,,,,,,,"White (examples: English, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Slovakian)",,Woman,,Renting,,"$30,000 - $49,999"

I want an electric vehicle and have for about 10 years. So, obviously I chose that. It disgusts me that there aren't more public charging stations. This goes back to my comment about communities. If they were more available, I think more people would consider and purchase electric cars. I've heard countless friends say 'oh, but there's no where to charge them'. Bike lanes, yes please, we need more. More electric TTC, obviously. And stop it with the busses. No one likes busses. Bus drivers don't even like busses. Stop. Just stop. They have crap capacity, they stink, they're noisy, they're bouncy/jumpy and horrible for anyone with a mobility issue. They're just awful. The only people who want/like busses are people who don't have to ride them. Oh, and freight, yes. Obviously, but I feel like people in Toronto won't care about freight. They don't see it so it doesn't exist. Even though that's how we get our goods, they don't see the big picture. So I feel like that one's gonna be a hard sell, which is why I unchecked it.

These damn Gypsy Moths will kill our trees in the next 2 to 3 years, so what's your plan to replace the trees? You won't spray or treat malvern and we have so many beautiful, mature trees out here.

However, not all Toronto neighbourhoods are walkable - this needs to change. Additionally, cycling infrastructure NEEDS to be better. I cycled all the time in Mississauga because they had the infrastructure that allowed that. I haven't biked in Toronto at all because I'm too scared. We need to shut some streets down so only pedestrian and cycling traffic is allowed. The ActiveTO program last year proved how successful such a change can be in getting people to switch away from cars. Public transit is always going to be important to get people to areas of the city that are just too far to get to on your feet or on a bike.","There is always a small minority that clutches their pearls whenever anyone suggests making things better for pedestrians and cyclists at the expense of drivers.

We need to educate people about this and help people reduce food waste - I can guarantee many people would try harder to limit food waste if they knew the damage it caused. We also desperately need to get away from the throw-away culture we live in. Most people I talk to don't WANT to throw things away when they break, but have no choice - repairing an item often costs much more than just buying a new one would, or is outright impossible. We also need to reduce how much garbage is created just through packaging. All these things tie together, too - food waste that's caused by food being sold in packages too big for households to consume before it goes bad, garbage that's created by buying new products with unnecessary packaging, etc. It's not one or the other, we have to deal with all of these issues together.","It'll be difficult to get people to change their habits, especially if it'll require things to be a little less convenient. Returning to a 'waste not, want not' culture is going to be hard after generations of 'waste all you want, there will always be more stuff to buy'. I think in some cases we need to take the choice away from people - e.g. my local grocery store recently did away with plastic bags altogether (they're just not available at all) and it's been interesting to watch people react to being told they could take a paper bag (inconvenient to carry) or buy a reusable one (costs more); hopefully they will remember to bring their own bag next time (it would be interesting to see stats on this).

Improving infrastructure, removing negative options, and otherwise shifting the status quo will mean people will adjust. At the end of the day humans are lazy and do what's easiest; we need to ensure that what's easiest is also what's going to lead to a net zero city.  Education and outreach can only do so much when the infrastructure just isn't there to support actions. E.g. I've been trying to reduce how much garbage and food waste I produce; while I was able to significantly cut back the amount of waste I generate, it's basically impossible to get rid of everything and still lead a reasonably normal lifestyle. I know how harmful single-waste packaging is but the fact is if I ever want to eat a cucumber again, I have to buy it wrapped in plastic because there is no alternative available to me. I try to only buy food in quantities I can consume but lots of food is sold pre-packaged in sizes intended for a family of 4, not a person living alone. As a result, I end up throwing out food. This is where governments can improve things - you can legislate and make it mandatory for producers to make greener options easy to find. You can make them the default - whether that's creating a circular economy or making public transit a better option than a personal vehicle.

That is just a fact! This means that government needs to understand how people live and enact appropriate policies to reduce emissions of those activities.  The bike lanes are a perfect example of where the city is going off the rails. The city is making all sorts of, for most people, very inconvenient changes in order to build bike lanes. The assumption is that if you build it they will come. But the reality is that for most people cycling is a recreating; not a primary means of getting around. Cycling advocate groups love to tout statistics about how many people use the bike lanes on a sunny day in August but they (a) never mention that the number of people moving by car or transit on those same roads at the same time is orders of magnitude greater and (b) never seem to provide statistics on the colder sunny day in Jan or Feb. Wouldn't it make more sense to reduce the emission from those very same cars rather than pander to the fantasies of a few cyclists? Years ago the only option for that was to reduce the number of cars on the roads and in that context I suppose bike lanes made a certain sense. However, as Mr. Musk and Tesla have shown, there is another option today - electric cars. Every auto manufacturer has them now! Don't inconvenience drivers by constricting their primary arteries with mostly unused bike lanes. Create policies that will convince people to buy electric cars! Electrify the transit system! Another example is nuclear. The state of the art there WAS dangerous as illustrated by Chernoble and Fukashima. However, current state of the art reactors are much safer so governments should be enacting policies to encourage their construction. Solar cells and battery storage is yet another example.

If building owners are either not aware of their options, or feel that they are too expensive/inconvenient, they won't make the necessary changes. Support for low-carbon construction and energy efficient retrofits would include education and perhaps subsidies. Education needs to be through many channels, to build awareness and a feeling of not wanting to be left out or the last to make certain upgrades. For priority #3, I had trouble choosing between reporting/limiting emissions from all buildings and requiring net-zero emissions for City buildings. If the reporting can be done, so that it can be tracked (like the vaccination campaigns) it will encourage progress and permit targeted initiatives in areas that are slower to change. Harder to do than requiring zero emissions for City-owned buildings (which I think should be done anyway), but more impactful if done well.","Reporting and limiting greenhouse gas emissions from homes would be the hardest for me personally, as a homeowner, and I think for many of my neighbours. We might well not undertake any new construction, or make any retrofits, for many years unless there was some stimulus. Many people just let their houses run as is for a couple of decades, if there isn't a problem that they perceive and they aren't thinking of selling.

Of course the City and other levels of gov't should be working on policy, but it depends on who is in government and we cannot wait. Renewable natural gas is a fine interim measure, but ultimately demand for natural gas should drop. Energy storage is the issue with solar (or wind/water) power. There is also the problem that in weather events, it is our hydro that goes out, not the gas, which make me reluctant to give up my gas furnace. If there were decent energy storage, it would help to cover outages, and would facilitate use of solar power and district energy systems.","Installation of solar, without improved energy storage capacity.

Last mile delivery has to be compatible with bike and pedestrian last mile transportation and short trips. Middle mile freight and bus rapid transit should use low-emission vehicles. There should also be a restructuring of incentives for businesses to use low-emissions delivery strategies.","I am always sad when I see people start families and then say 'we had to get a car'. It is not necessary to have a car in order to raise children. The services families need have to be nearby, or quickly and safely accessible by transit, and the roads have to be safe and not full of massive speeding cars (including electric ones). It also needs to be much easier to get out of the city for people without cars - not having a car in Toronto at the moment makes one a second-class citizen, because some kinds of activity are closed to one.

I estimate about $100,000 total cost, not counting any other improvements a homeowner may want to add. I'll have to borrow the money. Plus, I don't know how there will be enough contractors to do this for all the buildings in Toronto over the same time period. I think my best option would be to just replace my gas boiler with an electric one, next time it needs to be replaced in about 20 years.

Subways are faster, more weather reliable, have greater capacity, are 100% electric and don't reduce vehicle road capacity. The GTA is growing constantly and people will not want to switch out of their gas cars unless public transit is an attractive alternative Home owners and private industry can take care of electric vehicle charging stations. Electric vehicles are so much more expensive than gas vehicles that incentives are either too small or just increase my taxes by the same amount so residents are no further ahead. Bikes will never be more than 3% of total city trips, especially in bad weather.","Poor & even middle income people will not be able to afford electric vehicles (almost double the price vs gas cars), especially since they can barely afford gas vehicles now, so they will not switch to electric ones. Any required incentives to subsidize a major part of electric vehicle purchases would cause a taxpayer revolt. The best bet is to build-out the subway infrastructure and make it free, at least then everyone one can use and benefit from it. The other challenge is residential charging stations in neighbourhoods with street parking. Building sidewalk charging stations every 2 car lengths is going to be cost prohibitive for the city/taxpayers.

Methane gas is no longer needed, nor safe, as the 'bridge fuel' it once was to support our transition to renewables.","1) Significant costs of retrofitting (we are planning our own home retrofit right now, and it will be costly).  2) City permitting and committee of adjustment are overwhelmed with applications, and the approvals process is taking an exceedingly long time. Our architect and engineering consultant have both said this repeatedly, and they have said it is impacting ALL of the projects they're working on. The City needs to re-structure it's permitting and approvals process, with prioritized support for emissions-reducing retrofits, and retrofits that densify living space in the city (e.g. creating a new apartments within an existing building) which leverage existing structures and help prevent sprawl.",,,,,Work with other levels of government to ensure low-carbon and resilient energy policies to enable local solutions.,"Older buildings emit the most, so need to be specifically targeted for retrofit. District energy is great for new build, but may be challenging to install in older neighbourhoods. If the federal government can help the City support the rapid deployment of heat pumps, allowing buildings to switch off natural gas heating, that could bring about a lot of methane emissions reductions very quickly. Rooftop solar makes a lot of sense in the city, ground mount doesn<92>t. Toronto Hydro<92>s rooftop solar application process needs to be updated and streamlined (see below).","Toronto Hydro's distributed solar application process for rooftop solar is designed for rooftop systems to be a maximum of 10kW AC (13kW DC). This is based on old solar panel technology. I believe it is based on the 10kW AC maximum nameplate of the now-defunct MicroFIT program. That program was launched in 2009. Greentech media states: <93>The average nameplate power output of a standard 72-cell multi-silicon module was around 290 watts in 2010. Today, consumers can expect at least 345 watts at one-tenth of the 2010 price.<94> This means that it is now space-wise AND cost-effective to install > 10kW AC capacity on a residential rooftop in Toronto. Toronto Hydro needs to update its application and permitting standards to reflect current solar technology. The application fee for >10kW AC is $500, and the application fee for >10kW is $2,500. Why is that? This is a disincentive for installing higher efficiency panels. It doesn<92>t allow for maximal use of the roof space or optimal utilization of the balance of system (inverter, wiring, etc.) The 10kW AC threshold no longer makes sense. You can look to standard residential PV inverter product offerings as an indicator, they used to be made for 10kW, and now they are made with higher nameplate ratings. Lastly, it doesn't make sense to me that urban rooftop solar applicants must apply using the same process as LRP projects (various technologies, 500kW+). As an example of how to streamline rooftop solar, please see the City of Lancaster California<92>s rooftop PV application form, below, it is specifically tailored to One- and Two-Family Dwellings  References; Greentech media article: https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what City of Lancaster residential PV application form (also needs updating to >10kW!): https://www.cityoflancasterca.org/home/showpublisheddocument/35552/636457512995830000",,,,Expand bike and pedestrian infrastructure and priority zones.,Expand public transit and accelerate implementation of bus rapid transit.,Continue electrification of the TTC fleet.,"We need to move away from private vehicles in the city. Exceptions for people with disabilities and mobility needs, of course. Electrification for TTC and last-mile delivery, yes. But we need to do much more than electrification. The TO Core plan says that by 2041, the population is projected to nearly double to a potential population of 475,000. I think that is a conservative estimate. The whole of downtown needs to be pedestrianized. Look to Paris as an example: Paris seeks to ban through traffic in city centre by 2022. We already know about the co-benefits of pedestrianizing, and we could be reaping the benefits right now. All the more important when smoke from Ontario wildfires is making our air quality that much worse. It<92>s not just the absence of vehicle tailpipe emissions, but the absence of tire and road wear particles; the tiny, cigar-shaped bits of rubber tread laced with asphalt. No tech development required, just planning. We can start pedestrianizing right now. Cleaner air. Fewer asthma cases in kids. No reason to delay.","People I know, especially those with small kids, use their cars a lot in the city. The vital piece to this transition is making active transportation and TTC the fastest, most enjoyable, and most convenient options. That means pedestrian and bike/scooter/wheelchair infrastructure that is safe for all ages and abilities. It means prioritization of plowing for pedestrians and bike/scooter/wheelchairs. And it means transit that is fast, frequent, free (100% free for all), convenient and ENJOYABLE (clean, not overcrowded, great air circulation, easily accessible for those who want/need to ride with mobility devices and strollers). And plenty of easy-to-access public washrooms at transit stops! It should be faster to TTC somewhere than to drive.",Conduct a city-wide consumption-based emissions inventory and set a reduction target.,"Reduce city-wide material consumption and increase circularity (i.e., efficient re-use and recovery of resources).",,"It's hard to reduce what we don't measure. We do need a consumption-based emissions inventory and a reduction target. And we need to push back hard on the plastics industry and plastics lobby.

When we already have a plastic-choked planet, they are showing no signs of slowing down.","It is extremely difficult to reduce plastic use during Covid, for many reasons.

As settlers we don<92>t know the history of this land, and that is the challenge. We have to learn vital teachings from Indigenous communities, about the agreements that governed this land sustainably for millennia, before Toronto was named Toronto.  I have been learning by listening to Eriel Deranger of Indigenous Climate Action (who you worked with for the <91>Indigenous Knowledge Workshop<92> in 2018). Eriel reminds us that Indigenous Peoples have been on the front lines of the climate crisis the longest, they are most impacted, and they have answers to the climate crisis, and therefore need to be leading climate policy and land use discussions, not merely consulted. It will be a challenge for my community to learn to listen to Indigenous Peoples and accept their leadership, and not to take an extractive approach to <93>sharing knowledge<94>.  I learned from Ange Loft that the Dish With One Spoon Treaty may not only be interpreted to be about ensuring that there<92>s enough food to go around, but about other material needs as well. The treaty teaches to take only what you need and ensure there is enough for everyone<85> Settlers need to learn to take only what we need. (A consumption emissions self-inventory?) That will be a challenge.  I learned from Dr. Pam Palmater that <93>a fair transfer of land, wealth and power<94> is required to restore the place of Indigenous Peoples in the GTHA, and that one of the things we require for true reconciliation is a significant number of seats on every municipal council dedicated for Indigenous Peoples. Note that the MMIWG report Calls for Justice includes a call for the restoration of the place of Indigenous women and girls in governance roles. (Please read this paper in full, linked below.)  I learned from the Indigenous Land Stewardship Circle that the carcinogenic pesticides being applied by City workers to eliminate <91>invasive species<92> in High Park are not only harming the species they<92>re intended to eradicate, but that they also severely impact the surrounding ecosystem. And I learned that High Park<92>s Black Oak savanna, approximately 4000 years old, is a landscape traditionally stewarded by Indigenous Peoples, partly through judicious and periodic controlled burns. Delicate savanna ecosystems offer good growing conditions for food crops, and also respite from biting inspects (and we know that climate change is bringing with it mosquitos carrying west nile and other diseases, and expanding tick populations). Settlers need to recognize our place as guests on this land. We need to work to dismantle the systems that have caused climate change, and work to restore the place of Indigenous Peoples. All of this is a challenge. It<92>s also what we need to do to live. https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/imfg/research/bold-ideas/restoring-the-place-of-indigenous-peoples-in-the-gtha/","In the video presentation accompanying this survey, you list the <91>Indigenous Knowledge Workshop<92> in 2018, for which the City's E&E Division and Resilience Office partnered with Indigenous Climate Action. I'm revisiting this excerpt from the Summary of Discussions: 'There was general agreement that Indigenous peoples have essential, far-reaching knowledge and practices that are missing today, grounded in the laws of the land and Natural and higher laws (which do not need validation through Canada<92>s legal systems), and that consulting Indigenous peoples in relation to climate work cannot be an <93>add- on process<94> <96> especially given the challenges to effectively addressing our crisis, challenges inherent to the dominant systems around us. The city would do well to deeply consider and defer to inherent indigenous leadership and legal systems as they emerge (and they are emerging), and to relate to these Indigenous systems as reflections of the <93>law of the land.<94> And so, the nature of the relationship needs to change in relation to climate work, from one that still reflects colonial domination to one that moves into a process of collaboration. After all, climate and other environmental catastrophes are intimately related to colonialism.' Has the City has pursued any further engagement with Indigenous people since this 2018 meeting? Has the City 'deeply considered and deferred to inherent Indigenous leadership and legal systems', as suggested? 'If the city does not account for and address colonization in its policies it will keep repeating the same problematic behaviours.' TransformTO has identified many harmful systems we need to dismantle (gas heating, gas cars, plastic waste, etc). The systems we need to build are those discussed by Indigenous Climate Action and participants in the 2018 Workshop. But when I read that report and look at the City's operations today, and even this survey, I can't tell if the teachings that were offered that day were taken to heart.",30-54,3 digits of your postal code:,M6J,Ethnic or cultural backgound:,European,,,,,,,,"White (examples: English, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Slovakian)",,Woman,,Prefer not to answer,,Prefer not to answer

The impact of low-carbon materials and construction practices is significant, and the City should limit permissible GG emissions from the use of construction materials produced elsewhere, <93>imported<94> into the City for use in buildings, and eventually disposed of. Many traditional materials and techniques are low-carbon, or even absorb carbon from the atmosphere while serving structural purposes (e.g. lime plasters & renders); some, such as double-hung wood sash windows can achieve energy savings similar to modern disposable windows with a much shorter payback period and much less waste. When storm windows are added to a sash window system, they will perform just as well, if not better, than a newly manufactured double-glazed unit. Traditional materials and techniques, such as wood sash windows, contribute greatly to the architectural character of a building, and may last for hundreds of years if properly maintained. Support for Workforce Development: use of low-carbon materials and construction practices should create jobs that resist <93>Taylorisation,<94> as workers must develop complex skills, as opposed to merely installing factory mass-produced units. Much construction and maintenance is labour-intensive, so adequate numbers of workers must be prepared to meet demand.

In fact, each system benefits the other. There is substantial evidence from Germany and Switzerland that combining solar panels and vegetation can produce the following benefits:  1. Solar/Photovoltiac panels can work more efficiently on a roof when installed over a green roof system. The micro-climate around the panels is important. If it is too hot, the panels can lose efficiency. The green roof element can have a cooling effect, especially in summer. Year round, green roofs can help to keep ambient temperatures around the panels at or near 25? C. This is the best temperature for solar panels to work most efficiently.  2. A green roof makes the installation of A-frame panels easier. The green roof element provides the ballast to hold the A-frames and panels in place. This means there is no impact on the waterproofing layer below.  3. The PV panels should also increase the diversity of vegetation and therefore also fauna using the green roof. The panels can create shaded areas underneath, with rain run-off making damper areas to the front and drier areas behind. This creates a <91>habitat mosaic<92>, allowing a wider variety of vegetation to flourish, in turn attracting a wider range of butterflies, bees, beetles and other species. District Energy Systems: I think there are many neglected opportunities throughout the City to reduce emissions and increase efficiency by producing energy locally in low-carbon district systems. The City should consider using local parks, school-grounds, under-used roadways and parking lots to locate low-carbon district energy systems harnessing energy from renewable sources, such as heat recovery, geo-exchange and solar thermal, to heat and cool multiple buildings in the surrounding community. Local schools have been closed for months at a time during the covid crisis: imagine what might have been accomplished if the period of vacancy had been used to create heat-recovery and/or geo-exchange systems on those properties to provide clean energy to their neighbourhoods. Other Government Levels: unless Toronto is to become a province or at least a charter city with the power and authority to govern itself and control its own revenues, it will continue to be a creature of the Province of Ontario, and depend on the Province to provide climate-informed decisions, low-carbon energy policies, and generous funding for local solutions.",Producing renewable natural gas from waste: where would such production facilities be located?

Loose Enforcement of Speed Limits: In the U.S., speeding is associated with one death every 47 minutes. Annually, excessive speed is a top risk factor for motor vehicle crashes on par with intoxication. According to Professor Gregory Shill, exceeding the lawful limit by even 15 km per hour seldom is punished. Some jurisdictions expressly forbid automated enforcement of speed laws even though it has proven to save lives.  2. In the post-World War II era, planners around North America established minimum parking quotas that required developers to overbuild off-street parking irrespective of demand, which suburbanized cities and curbed walking by creating a landscape hostile to people on foot.  3. Electrification requirements focus narrowly on fuel emissions and energy efficiency, ignoring - for example - particulate emissions generated by tire and brake pad wear. One study found these accounted for 85% to 90% of toxic particulate emissions from cars, causing cancer and a host of other diseases.  4. Pedestrians often suffer grave injuries compared with passengers in vehicles involved in accidents. However, motorists are not required to carry personal injury liability policies adequate to compensate pedestrians who are seriously injured.  5. So-called <93>green<94> vehicles still rely on traditional brake pads, tires, and other equipment that generate large amounts of toxic and cancer-causing emissions. <93>Green<94> vehicles, like all other motor vehicles, can still kill their users, as well as pedestrians and bike riders, when they crash.  6. Walking<97>usually the healthiest travel method, which society has the greatest interest in promoting<97>is not subsidised at all. Walkers, people who ride the bus, and people who bike effectively pay drivers to drive to work.","Persistence of private electric vehicles in public spaces, supported by incentives to purchase electric vehicles and by subsidisation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, will only exacerbate the health, safety, environmental, and other inefficiencies, injustices and inequities currently associated with the proliferation of private fossil-fuel powered vehicles.

Agriculture - together with forestry - accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock rearing contributes to global warming through the methane gas the animals produce, but also via deforestation to expand pastures, for example. An Oxford study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that the adoption of plant-based diets could significantly reduce diet-based contributions to climate change: it found that primarily eliminating red meat and reducing dairy consumption would significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint, and also save lives. <93>Imbalanced diets, such as diets low in fruits and vegetables, and high in red and processed meat, are responsible for the greatest health burden globally and <85> (are) also responsible for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions<94> (Dr. Marco Springmann, Oxford Martin School).  A UN report (2014) quantified Livestock Impacts on Climate Change: *One cow produces between 70 and 120 kg of methane per year;  *Methane from livestock accounted for 39% of all the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture; *55% of emissions came from beef cattle;  *By 2050, livestock emissions could increase by 30% or more;  *Consumption of fossil fuel along supply chains accounts for about 20% of the livestock sector<92>s emissions;  *Feed production and land-use change represented 45% and 39% percent of total emissions, respectively.  According to Oxford, the dietary shift to a plant-based diet could contribute the following benefits: *Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds;  *8 million lives saved by 2050;  *Mitigate up to $1.5 trillion in climate-related damages;  *Significant savings in healthcare costs.","Sourcing goods that do, in fact, participate in <93>circularity,<94> by maximising efficiency in the use of finite resources, by promoting transition to renewable resources, and by ensuring the recovery of materials (and products) at the end of their useful life.

ROI should not be neglected but it needs to be positioned within a SLO business strategy - social license to operate.

We need to focus on structures not only in terms of reducing impact but also in terms of creating positive and sustainable output/outcomes. Urban structure should be put to work to sustain the environment. We must move beyond thinking about 'reduction' and focus on 'production' to achieve positive results. Building/structures must be positioned for the continuous productivity of energy.,"The challenge is in our strategic thinking capability. It requires us to move out of the reductionist mode of thinking and into a pro-ductionist mode of acting.

It is not just about changing behaviour; it is about changing how we live.",Increase uptake of electric vehicles through incentives.,,,,Expand public transit and accelerate implementation of bus rapid transit.,,"For me, public transport inside the city must replace personal automobiles inside the city. We need to restrict the city to public transport systems and eliminate personal automobiles. It also requires that we expand the public system beyond the city so as to provide accessibility to the city amenities, jobs, and so on from the region. Transit must become reliable, on time all the time, regional and wide ranging. And electrified. BUT we must be recognize that electrification creates other environmental problems that have an impact on the provincial hydro grid. It is not a 100% carbon neutral solution. Energy to run electric vehicles has to be generated and that will have an environmental impact. Let's ensure that electrification does not offload environmental problems onto other structures and processes.","Regionalization of the transit/transport system has many challenges, ranging from jurisdictional, geographic, geo-political, economic, social, to name just a few. As I already indicated, going electric transport is not a 100% carbon neutral solution and could potentially offload local problems to other regions and facilities. Electricity still needs to be generated, and going electric transport increases the need for electric consumption which in turn increases the need for electric production. Let's think holistically when considering electrification.",,"Reduce city-wide material consumption and increase circularity (i.e., efficient re-use and recovery of resources).",,"The time has come for the city to create a circular economy strategy. We need to move away from reduction thinking to production thinking - how can we use what we no longer need or want in order to achieve social, economic and environmental goals? We need to balance all 3 when developing environmental strategies, so that we do not lose sight of the entire socio-economic fabric of society.","Circularity has many challenges, not the least being order of magnitude. Toronto and region is spread out, heavily populated, highly residential. How do we make the case for what is termed 'circular economy' for individuals, neighborhoods, and residences? Notice the term: circular economy. Once again, economic factors need to be taken into consideration to make any of this work. We need to answer the question for each individual: what's in it for me? Pushing the 'do good' button is not sufficient; pushing the 'must do' button is not sufficient; positioning circularity as a personal and organizational benefit beyond doing good for the environment is the key challenge. For companies, it is about economic sustainability; for individuals it is about personal sustainability and by extension social/community sustainability. What's in it for me is the challenge.","Increase tree canopy cover, biodiversity and enhance greenspaces.","Achieve equitable distribution of the urban forest, increasing tree canopy where it is most needed.",,,,,,"Go green, go green, go green.

Every neighborhood group, every community group, every household, including apartments/condos, and every office structure should go green, not just in terms of reducing carbon footprint but in terms of actually doing something green - trees, gardens, forests, and so on. Yet another dimension of the theme I keep repeating: get people to act and produce, do something, and not just reduce and recycle. Develop a positive green attitude, better known as bio-philia...the love of biologicals. And recognize the additional benefits to mental and social health. Think holistically in terms of the whole person and multi-dimensional impact of well being.
